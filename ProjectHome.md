kisgearth is a small perl script that gives you the
possibility to convert your kismet xml and gps logfiles
to google earth kml files.
you can apply a lot of filters and use sorting/ordering
functions in order to get the best results.
every time i tried kismets gpsmap tool none of the
mapservers were available. so i decided to write my own tool
while using the best resources available.
